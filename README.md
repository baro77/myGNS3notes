# myGNS3notes
My own unleashed notes about GNS3 and appliances, taken while working with GNS3. I use them to avoid forgetting what I have discovered step by step and as a checklist when I have to reinstall the whole environment. I hope they can be useful to others, so I publish them under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/, quite a permissive license.

Just few points
